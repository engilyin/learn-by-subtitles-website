This app will help you to learn spoken language using subtitles very efficiently.
There are 2 modes:

1. Video mode: watch the video with both languages subtitles (learning and known ones) . Easy to come back and repeat an interested phrase, navigate through the subtitles, bookmark position, send phrases to other apps.

2. Simple mode: to read the subtitles text one by one. And when the video file is not available for you.

Both modes allow you to share and store the interesting phrases for further learning.

You can create a lesson with required subtitles easily searching it right on the Open Subtitles service (opensubtitles.org). Alternatively you can add it right from your device.

The spoken language is quite different from what you are learning from books and other traditional ways to learn languages. You need to practice with native speakers. However if you do not have familiar native speakers watching the video with subtitles is a good alternative. You are unable to speak with a video and it will not correct you but you will learn how native speakers speak in real life and different situations, different social groups etc.

This app will help you to do that efficiently.
